game: XOXODOKU
To win a complete game it is required to win at three tic tac toe (according to rule: |-\/).
After one tic tac toe is conquered unused fields become '-'.
During the game, it is possible to fill up any field unless it is a part of conquered tic tac toe.

First it is necessary to chose tic tac toe in order:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
and then a field in tic tac toe.
Fun guaranteed :)
